        Google Analytics uses cookies, i.e. text files stored on your computer to enable analysis
        of website usage by you. Information generated by the cookie about your use of this
        website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored
        there. In case of activated IP anonymization on this website, however, your IP address
        is previously truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other
        states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional
        cases is a full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the United States and
        truncated there. On behalf this website's owner, Google will use this information to
        evaluate your use of the website, compile reports about website activities, and provide
        the website's operator with further services related to website and Internet usage.
        The IP address sent from your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with
        other data by Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting your
        browser software; in this case, however, please note that you might not be able to fully
        use all functions offered by this website. In addition, you can prevent data generated by
        the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) from being
